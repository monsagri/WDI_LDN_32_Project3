###### Conception & project planning/management

Where all good ideas are created. The pub. I have mad love for cosmology and stars, luckily an ideal shared by the rest of the team.

Brought out a little note pad and started throwing any and all things we could implement which was a good place for concept but with the time limitation we soon realised ((via trello and wireframes)) that we'd have to limit down -> ((can come back to this when talking about what we would add had we that time))
"https://stargazerapp.herokuapp.com/#!/events" <- wireframes.

We were able to push past the initial MVP as we continued to add features but kept it as a reference in order to maintain consistency.

###### Design phase - wireframing/user flows etc

In the design phase we simultaneously worked on creating a Trello Board, in which we ordered features according to MoSCoW, and designing Wireframes as we went along.  
Our initial wireframes ended up incorporating features outside of MVP, so we ended up redesigning them before we started the build process.

** SHOW BALSAMIQ HERE ?**

###### Build process - talk through how this worked, show some code

Decided to divide up work by front/backend
Use a "Todays work" card on Trello to keep on track with each days progress.

One major challenge was acquiring enough data to make the project worthwhile. Astronomy APIs are rare and even more rarely well documented.

###### Demo of app/site

** Demo shit yay. **

We're going to walk you through a user journey of the site
You're thinking, I've got this date I want to impress, the weather seems like it might be good (but who knoooows) and I know she loves stars. I KNOW, IMA CHECK STARGAZER!! They are always reliable for telling me what celestial events are coming up.

Hey cool, some people have commented on this saying they're going! Let me NOT go to that one cos I want to be alone ;)

Let me favourite that one so I can find it easily later on my profile.

Oh cool you can add a gallery image, I'll check that out after I've attended.

Um, weird, how come they haven't mentioned Asteroid number 758693 XjfjfSJfh ?? Ima add it for them.

Now, where shall we go...? This map in theory will show me my location on this map, and I can see what the weather will be like at each place - cool! It's a shame that they're black, but I promise they're there.

aw man, its raining today. Guess we can't see stars.

nahh. We got you. Check out one of the FREEEEE observatories.

Let me choose one to go to, and see what the route would be like. I would see the directions, but that function disappeared somewhere along the way.

Weather looks good, route looks good, no one appears to be going here too - great I'll favourite it to save it for later.

Now let me see if my favourites showed up.

oh look I can change my profile picture!

I wonder if they know about gilbert park?

*adds gilbert park*

OooOoOoO autocomplete and filestack gr8

I wonder who made this fukin sik app

about us - dis us

fukin sik.

**OR**

act like a dumb person and ask questions like

HEY, I REALLY WANNA GO STARGAZING, IF ONLY THERE WAS AN APP FOR THAT

HERE'S A GREAT APP FOR THAT

OOO THAT BACKGROUND IS TACKY

YEAH! BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PUT AN OPACITY LAYER ON THE BACKGROUND IMAGE, JUST IGNORE IT

###### Wins - what worked?
*This was our first experience coding as a team, as opposed to working solo or with a partner.   
It was a new experience that showed the differences in workflow, but also showcased how much more you're able to achieve when you pool resources.*
________

###### Blockers - what was difficult & how did you overcome it?
*There were some initial issues with merging files as we got accustomed to working as a team via Github, but during the week we quickly become familiar with the process.    
Unfortunately we ran into a major problem on the last day of the project, which ended up overwriting previous work with every commit.

We spent that evening pushing our communication as eloquently as we could in order to fix the mass of the issue with considerable success.*


###### MORE TIME
We would have liked to hide the directions displayed by google as they come in hard and fast, pushing the comments down. We made the executive decision to remove them all together.

It would have been nice to display multiple markers on one location to mark the several possible spots available in the one said location.

We could have created a function that changed the number values of 'moon phases' into images of the moons as it's quite difficult to tell what they mean without informed research.

We would have liked to add direct messaging so that users could keep in touch after events.

A global gallery, which would push images uploaded by users into a page for users to scroll through. (would be able to leave comments and all that jazz)
